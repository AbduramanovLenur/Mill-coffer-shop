  "roastingText": "New Refining Group is located in Kaliningrad and has its own warehouse and representative office in Moscow. The plant has been operating in the market of freshly roasted coffee and instant products for over 15 years. The plant has German Probat coffee roasting equipment and Italian agglomerators for the production of soluble products. <br> <br> Coffee comes in containers directly from plantations around the world. The company has long-term contracts for the supply of products. Each batch passes strict control at the factory to check the grain. The green beans are roasted, degassed and immediately sent to customers. Our roasters have been trained in Russia and abroad. We have our own approach to each batch of grain. <br> <br> We reveal the taste of each type of coffee.",
